Q.List the components of Hadoop 2.x and explain them in detail.


>Hadoop Common Module is a Hadoop Base API (A Jar file) for all Hadoop Components. All other components works on top of this module.
>HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features. It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
>YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture. It is also know as “MR V2”.
>MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is also know as “MR V1” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x with some updated features.
>Remaining all Hadoop Ecosystem components work on top of these three major components: HDFS, YARN and MapReduce.

When compared to Hadoop 1.x, Hadoop 2.x Architecture is designed completely different. It has added one new component : YARN and also updated HDFS and MapReduce component’s Responsibilities.

Hadoop 2.x has the following three Major Components:

1.HDFS
2.YARN
3.MapReduce

These three are also known as Three Pillars of Hadoop 2. Here major key component change is YARN. It is really game changing component in BigData Hadoop System.
